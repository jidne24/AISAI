# About AISAI

**AISAI â€” Automated IP-Secured Attendance Intelligence** is a campus-scale attendance verification solution that uses network-level device fingerprinting (IP) within controlled Wi-Fi to ensure single-device submissions and prevent proxy attendance.

## Motivation
Manual attendance consumes faculty time and is vulnerable to proxy entries. AISAI reduces administrative overhead while improving integrity of attendance data.

## Key technical choices
- **IP validation** inside a controlled Wi-Fi limits spoofing and prevents multiple submissions per device.
- **SQLite3** chosen for reliable, portable semester storage.
- **Pandas** for fast local aggregation/analytics.
- **Flask** for portability and quick UI prototypes.
